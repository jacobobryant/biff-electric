# Biff-Electric example

Example of using [Electric](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric) with Biff.

Run `bb dev` to get started. See `bb tasks` for other commands.

View [the latest commit](https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff-electric/commits/master)
to see how this differs from the regular Biff example app. To use Electric in
your own Biff project, it's recommended to create a Biff app
[the normal way](https://biffweb.com/docs/get-started/new-project/) and then
manually apply the changes in this project's latest commit. This ensures that
your project will be created with the latest version of Biffâ€”this repo won't
necessarily be upgraded to future Biff releases.
